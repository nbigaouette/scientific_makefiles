 * To add a new test, create a new .cpp file.
 * You can inspire yourself from "unit_testing/example.cpp".
 * Note that "BOOST_TEST_MODULE" can only be defined once (in
 * this case here) and should not be re-defined in other files.
 *
 * This is based on Boost's Test Library.

 * You'll need to install boost.
